# Project Contribution Guideline

1. HTML files should end with .html suffix. 
2. File names should not be more than 32 characters
3. Use relative links/paths for links and images from your branch project web pages to other web pages in the project.
4. We strongly suggest using all lowercase for letters because people make fewer mistakes.
5. The first character of the file should be a letter.
6. Use relative short name that are indicative to the content of the page.
7. Name files with images, with names that will help remember what is in them.
8. Class and id names must be relative to the bearing tags. 
9. Use 2 space indentation both in html code and css code

# Projects Tags' class and id naming Convention

> i.e. about.html   
``  <div class="about-container">  ``  
  
  ``  <div id="about-heading">  ``  
  
    ``  <p id="about-paragraph"></p>``  
    
    ``</div>``  
    
   ``</div>``
